     * laboratory: The results of observations generated by laboratories.  Laboratory results are typically generated by laboratories providing analytic services in areas such as chemistry, hematology, serology, histology, cytology, anatomic pathology (including digital pathology), microbiology, and/or virology. These observations are based on analysis of specimens obtained from the patient and submitted to the laboratory.

     * procedure: Observations generated by other procedures.  This category includes observations resulting from interventional and non-interventional procedures excluding laboratory and imaging (e.g., cardiology catheterization, endoscopy, electrodiagnostics, etc.).  Procedure results are typically generated by a clinician to provide more granular information about component observations made during a procedure.  An example would be when a gastroenterologist reports the size of a polyp observed during a colonoscopy.
